The 51-year-old first competed at an Olympics in Barcelona in 1992 and returns for his fifth Games alongside Daniel Meech and Sharn Wordley. Goodin, who is based in Sweden, also rode in the Sydney, Athens and Beijing Games between 2000 and 2008 and has been named aboard Backatorps Danny V for Tokyo.CHRISTEL YARDLEY/STUFFThe favourites in the pair also want to be in the New Zealand women's rowing eight in Tokyo.

It will be a different Olympic Games I am sure, but it is always exciting to be there.” Goodin was a member of the New Zealand team in their first Nations Cup showjumping win in Abu Dhabi in 2018. Meech's previous appearances at an Olympics were in Atlanta and Athens in 1996 and 2004 respectively.

He's expected to make a full recovery."Wrong place, wrong time," said Rosenhaus, who told ESPN that Twyman was in Washington visiting an aunt. "In talking to him today, he's going to be OK -- that's all that matters. We're thankful he's OK. He will make a full recovery."The 21-year-old suffered superficial exit wounds and will not need surgery, according to Rosenhaus.The Vikings said they are in direct contact with Twyman and his family and are "extremely thankful Jaylen is expected to make a full recovery."💜 Jaylen pic.twitter.com/5vEXkqWEfa— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) June 22, 2021 Minnesota drafted Twyman with the 199th pick in May.

The Highlanders prop was still a mixture of excitement and nerves on Tuesday morning following the unveiling of the All Blacks squad on Monday evening, but the 22-year-old made a special mention of his journey from a lifestyle block outside Gore to the rugby big time. “I’d like to think I’ve inspired parents and kids to stay in Southland and do their schooling in Southland,” said de Groot, who came through the Southland rugby system. “There is a pathway. It is tough ... you don’t get a lot of the limelight, but it can be done.

It can be done.” Those words will warm the hearts of old-school rugby fans in New Zealand, particularly ex front-rowers who have already noted that de Groot is something of a throwback to simpler times. The 126kg youngster – who named Carl Hayman as his favourite player and Jamie Mackintosh as another inspiration – plays with an uncomplicated desire to impose himself physically, and uses his words economically but with purpose.Joe Allison/Getty ImagesEthan de Groot is a no-nonsense prop who grew up on a lifestyle block outside Gore. The enormity of his callup was still sinking in as he fronted the media in Dunedin on Tuesday, but there was no disguising his happiness. “There was no words, really,” he said. “Just ‘wow’. It’s just a dream come true. I can’t believe it’s happened. I’m nervous. “... I was at home with my partner, watching the announcement on my phone. And then the phone kept vibrating for about two hours. “I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.” de Groot’s selection wasn’t entirely a surprise. His form during Super Rugby was excellent and even the prop himself thought he might be on the radar after a chat with All Blacks scrum coach Greg Feek about his scrum ”set-up”. Still, he beat the Blues’ Alex Hodgman and the Chiefs’ Aidan Ross to make the 36-man squad, and he paid tribute to older heads at the Highlanders for his rapid development this year. “I knew I was maybe in the picture when ‘Feeky’ came down.We spoke about scrumming but I never thought I’d make the initial squad. “Definitely, the coaching staff [helped me]. And the older guys in our team, like [Josh] Hohneck, DLB [Daniel Lienert-Brown], and our leaders in our group.” de Groot has already spoken to one of those leaders, Aaron Smith, about what to expect when he assembles with the rest of the All Blacks for the first time on Wednesday. Smith’s advice was simple: be yourself and don’t worry, I’ve got your back. But before that, de Groot has to dash back to Gore. “I’ve got a few things to sort out,” de Groot said. “My truck is packed to the rafters. “I’ve got to boost back to Gore and drop all my stuff back at my parents’, which they’ll be happy with, and then come back and fly up [to Auckland] on Wednesday.” The boy from Gore is about to hit the international stage.most popularAll Blacks squad: The unlucky ones, the new faces and controversial callsQuiz: Morning trivia challenge: June 22, 2021$12,000 damage after tenants set up animal rescue centre without landlord's permissionAs the America's Cup door (probably) closes, a new one opens for Auckland'What the hell is this?'

NC State outduels Vanderbilt for CWS winTags:NCSU, NC State baseball, College World Series, NCAA Baseball Posted June 21, 2021 9:35 p.m. EDTUpdated June 21, 2021 9:51 p.m. EDT By Joe Giglio, WRALSportsFanAll of the strikeouts from ace pitcher Jack Leiter couldn’t save Vanderbilt against NC State on Monday.Neither could the incessant whistling from the Commodores’ notoriously irritating superfans.Terrell Tatum hit a solo home run in the fifth inning and Sam Highfill threw seven-plus scoreless innings to lead the Wolfpack to a 1-0 win in the College World Series on Monday.NC State (37-18) is one win away from reaching the final best-of-3 series in Omaha, Neb. and playing for the first national title in program history and the school’s first since the men’s basketball team won it all in 1983.Vandy (46-16) won the CWS the last time it was played in 2019. Leiter and pitcher Kumar Rocker made the Commodores, the No. 4 overall seed, the favorites to win again in Omaha. Even if it means having to listen to Jeff Pack and Preacher Franklin, the "Vandy Whistlers" who make high-pitched piercing noises throughout each game.But this NC State team has had a knack for defying the odds. The Wolfpack knocked out the No. 1 overall seed, SEC champion Arkansas, in the Super Regional round.On Saturday, the Wolfpack hammered Stanford 10-4 to advance in the winners’ bracket, where it will stay until Friday when it will get a rematch with either Stanford or Vanderbilt. The Cardinal, who beat Arizona 14-5 in the losers' bracket on Monday, and the Commodores will meet in an elimination game on Wednesday.NC State improved to 7-1 in the NCAA tournament and won a second game in the CWS for the first time in three trips in program history. All of this for a team that started the season with a 1-8 record in conference play.The Wolfpack has come a long way since March."I go back to when we were 1-8 in the ACC and coach came into the locker room and said we're going to go on a run," Highfill said. "Sure enough, it has happened. These guys are unbelievable."Leiter (10-4), a projected top-10 pick in the upcoming MLB draft and the NCAA leader in strikeouts, went into the game as the star pitcher but Highfill stole the show. NC State has won 10 straight games started by Highfill (9-2), a second-year freshman from Apex."I had a lot of help behind me," Highfill said, noting the defensive standout play of third baseman Vojtech Mensik and rightfielder Devonte Brown.Highfill allowed only two hits through 7.1 innings. Reliever Evan Justice, who closed out Saturday's win over Stanford, came in for the final five outs.A double-play in the ninth, after Justice walked the leadoff batter, was also key for the Wolfpack.Leiter struck out 15 in a complete-game effort. He had a no-hitter through the first four innings until Tatum led off the fifth with a rocket shot to right field. NC State could only get three more hits but it wouldn't need any more runs. NC State needs one win to move into the final series. Either Stanford or Vanderbilt will have to beat the Wolfpack twice to advance to the best-of-3 finale, which is scheduled to start on Monday.SUGGEST A CORRECTION​ More On ThisIMAGE: 'Leits' out!

Hubbard, 43, was named in the New Zealand Olympic team for Tokyo on Monday, meaning she'll become the first recognised transgender athlete to compete at an Olympics, contesting the women’s super heavyweight category. Her selection has predictably ignited international debate on the issue and New Zealand’s leading politicians couldn't escape that on Tuesday, with Collins praising Hubbard but saying further talks are needed and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern saying the rules had been followed for her Olympic qualification.1 NEWSHubbard, David Liti, Kanah Andrews-Nahu and Megan Signal will be heading to Tokyo. Collins spoke of her admiration for Hubbard and how she had satisfied the selection system. But the National leader felt there were still areas that needed to be explored moving forward.

There is actually, unfortunately, that issue. “I think most people, like me, have no problem whatsoever with anybody's sexuality, or whether or not someone's transgender. The issue comes when other people, unfortunately, are disadvantaged. “So I think there needs to be some work done. And I think that work needs to be done with the Olympic committee and I think we all need to have a good honest conversation.” Collins had some sympathy for Hubbard. “Well I think there's clearly this issue that if the work has been done to a satisfactory standard, then we would have more people supporting Laurel.” Collins said. “I think it's really hard for Laurel. I mean, she is who she is, and she's trying to do her very best. I'd hate to see any bullying or any horrible comments about Laurel because she's just doing what she wants to do. “But I do think that there is an issue that needs to be addressed, somehow. I'm not sure I've got the answers to them, but I think it is something we do need to consider.”Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesLaurel Hubbard will contest the women’s super heavyweight category at the Tokyo Olympics. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the rules had been followed for Hubbard’s Olympics qualification and selection and that was what mattered most in the current environment. “That's the case for Laurel, but also the team in New Zealand - they have followed the rules,” Arden said on Tuesday.Pool/Getty ImagesJacinda Ardern says Laurel Hubbard’s Olympics selection has followed the rules. “Ultimately I leave it to those bodies ... and that’s the decision they've made, and it's in keeping with the standard that's been set globally.” Their thoughts came as former New Zealand Olympic weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs felt two gold medals should be awarded if Hubbard won her category in Tokyo. Lambrechs is opposed to Hubbard competing in the women's category as she believes she has a biological advantage. “If Laurel was to win gold then the next biological female [should] also win gold ... then Laurel would be a gold medallist as a transgender, and then we would have our female athlete as an Olympic champion as well,” Lambrechs said. Hubbard said in a statement on Monday that she was “grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders” , but she was not among those weightlifters selected for Tokyo to give interviews on Tuesday. most popularAll Blacks squad: The unlucky ones, the new faces and controversial callsQuiz: Morning trivia challenge: June 22, 2021$12,000 damage after tenants set up animal rescue centre without landlord's permissionAs the America's Cup door (probably) closes, a new one opens for Auckland'What the hell is this?'

NEW DELHI: India’s Olympic body has slammed as “unfair” strict rules imposed by the Japanese government on athletes from several Covid-hit nations for the Tokyo Games starting next month. Tokyo 2020 organisers said Monday that additional measures will be used to reduce infection risks from several countries, including India, that have seen “significant impact from variants” of Covid-19. The protocols will involve daily testing of athletes for a week before they depart for Japan and for them to “refrain from coming into contact with other teams for three days after they arrive” in Japan. But the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said the rules would cause athletes to lose three crucial training days. “Athletes are allowed to arrive in the Games village only five days before their event,” IOA president Narinder Batra and secretary Rajeev Mehta said in a joint statement released on Saturday. “Now three days will be wasted, this is the time the athletes need to be moving towards their mode to peak... highly unfair for Indian athletes, who have worked hard for five years, to be discriminated against just five days before the Olympics.” The sports administrators said 11 countries, including India, Pakistan and the UK, would be affected. “Where and when will the athletes have their breakfast, lunch, dinner during these three days, as everyone has food in the Games village food hall where all athletes and officials of other NOCs (National Olympic Committees) are present all the time,” the statement added. Where can athletes train? it asked, because “practice/training areas are never empty and athletes and officials of other NOCs are present all the time.” The Tokyo 2020 organisers said in a statement to AFP that they had received a document from India’s Olympic body. “For participants from areas such as India that have seen significant impact from variants, it is necessary that they follow more stringent rules than those outlined in the (athletes) Playbook, and are similar to the existing border control measures,” they added. But the organisers did not clarify whether athletes from the affected countries would be allowed to train in the three days after their arrival. Batra told AFP last week that Indian athletes will be fully vaccinated before the Games starting July 23. The country has eased some lockdown restrictions in recent weeks as it emerges from a brutal surge in infections and deaths in April and May. The International Olympic Committee said in late May that six countries – Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – had pledged to fully vaccinated their delegations and conduct additional testing. Some Indian athletes, including javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and wrestler Vinesh Phogat, are training abroad and will travel to Tokyo from their respective locations. But most of the Olympic team will depart from India. Despite its huge population, India won just two medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics. – AFP Did you like this article? 0 I love it 0 I like it 0 I dont like it TAGS 1 Olympic PRIME Manufactures can increase productivity, quality with collaborative robots PRIME Chinese monk who saved 8,000 strays is dog's best friend PRIME Maqis seizes corn gluten meal worth over RM290,000 from South Korea PRIME Rave at the palace: Macron resumes pre-Covid gig PRIME George Clooney to launch Los Angeles high school film program Today's popular GOING VIRAL Gay pride streaker disrupts play at US Open (Video) Home 22 Jun 2021 / 09:59 Two children caught in New York City shooting (Video) Lifestyle 20 Jun 2021 / 14:40 GI Joe reboot explores Snake Eyes’ origin Going Viral 18 Jun 2021 / 12:14 Rick and Morty Season 5 premieres from space Going Viral 18 Jun 2021 / 11:49 SUN MEDIA CORPORATION SDN BHD (221220-K) Level 4, Lot 6 Jalan 51/217 46050 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia Tel: +603-7784 6688 Fax: +603-7785 2624 / +603-7785 2625 Download the free APP Local World Business Sport Lifestyle Spotlight Opinion Gear Up!

Add it up and he just might be the most powerful player in the game.One other item: I would put Cole with David Cone and Pedro Martinez as the most passionate, insightful, articulate players with whom I have ever discussed the art of pitching.I bring this up because on Tuesday — after pitching the top of the first against the Royals — Cole is likely to be frisked with or without probable cause by a major league umpire who may or may not know exactly what he is looking for and then will serve as judge and jury to decide whether Cole has an illegal sticky substance on his person and needs to be ejected.That we have reached this moment speaks to many items, including that competitive people will seek to find advantages — legal and illegal. But the absurd stop-and-frisk on a baseball field that officially began Monday also illustrates anew how poorly MLB and the players association have worked together.Part of the problem is both sides read that sentence and immediately began blaming the other for the poisoned working relationship.On this matter, MLB believes it provided ample warning beginning with strongly worded memos from spring 2020 that enforcement on pitchers applying illegal sticky substances to the ball was coming and that it wanted union/player input. The players association feels MLB only offered input on the periphery and not on the substantive part of new guidance on handling sticking stuff.Gerrit ColeGetty ImagesEven if the union’s perception is accurate, it still had to a) see that momentum was building in the Commissioner’s Office to address this strongly and b) that it had to be proactive, where it could, to influence legislation that would impact the most important item on the field (the ball), the most relevant relationship (pitcher/hitter) and put half its constituency (pitchers) in line to be humiliated and punished.This brings us to Cole and trying to move forward productively amid a relationship often mired in past recriminations. Following his last start against the Blue Jays, Cole said of the sticky situation, “I don’t have a solution. We are aligned in a lot of areas with the Commissioner’s Office on this. Just talk with us and work with us.”Cole should force that issue by using his station as perhaps the most powerful player in the game. Cole cares a great deal about baseball and pitching. That positions him to be an agent of change for what pitchers need while keeping in mind that the rise of pitching dominance with sticky substances was not good for the game. see also Mets’ Jacob deGrom first pitcher checked for foreign substances under new MLB protocol MLB’s best pitcher also was the first to get closely... In many ways that last start, which Cole left frustrated about his lack of grip on the ball in this less-gooey world, actually emphasized what is possible. Cole is so special as a pitcher he could remake himself — more working down in the zone, more changeups, a quicker pace — and still hold a strong Blue Jay offense to two runs in eight innings; albeit with just four strikeouts. There is no place in a baseball bible that pitchers have to strike out double-digits to excel. In a fair environment, the best pitchers, like Cole, will still rise. We just have to get to that fair environment.And just the threat of action on sticky stuff has led to spin-to-velocity ratios dropping and offensive output increasing the last three weeks. Hit by pitches have stayed neutral despite pitchers voicing that no sticky stuff will lead to more hit by pitches. But if Cole thinks it will lead to more plus a greater number of injuries (though, again, there have been plenty of pitching injuries through the Sticky Era), then his voice should be heard. It needs to be heard. He is a passionate expert with a large platform. If the commissioner will not directly listen, Cole has plenty of forums to speak out on what he perceives is best for the sport.Maybe I am naive, but I think MLB should and would listen to him. I am more naive to think if the sides work together in an area in which they are “aligned,” what else would be possible to work on together.In the present, though, action is needed on pitcher stop-and-frisk and umpires being given outsized power. The only way to do that is for the sides to brainstorm to find an acceptable level of tack for pitchers that is not weaponized to heighten spin and warp the hitter-pitcher dynamic. That is tougher than it sounds. But I can’t think of anybody who would have more passion or insight into how that can be done than the Yankee starter who is going to be inspected by an umpire before fans and a TV audience not long after 7 p.m. Tuesday.

There was a wall of support for the Danish team in Parken for their vital final match of Group B.(AP/Pool: Hannah McKay)The longer the game went on, the more the tension rose, particularly as Finland was drawing with Belgium in the other game, a score that was doing Denmark's chances of advancing no good.LoadingFinally, with half-time beginning to approach, Mikkel Damsgaard received the ball from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg 25 metres out in the centre of the park.The young Sampdoria forward looked up, stepped to his right and unfurled a curling, dipping shot that left Russian goalkeeper Matfei Safonov standing.This set off wild celebrations in the stadium and released some of the tension. It was 1-0 at half-time, however, and everyone realised that one defensive slip could end Danish hopes. Yussuf Poulsen took advantage of a bad back pass from Russia to score Denmark's opener in their 4-1 win.(AP/Pool: Martin Meissner)When the slip came, however, it was from Russia, with an awful back pass letting in Yussef Poulsen for a tap-in goal to double Denmark's lead.With 20 minutes to go, the game took another turn as Russia was given a penalty for a foul in the box, and Artem Dzyuba fired home from the spot.The nerves returned, only for some relief a few minutes later when news emerged that Belgium had taken the lead against Finland in the other game.LoadingThen, when the ball fell cleanly to Andreas Christensen on the edge of the box with 11 minutes left, the Danish right-back struck the purest of right-foot thunderbolts, that rocketed past Safonov in the Russian goal to hit the net — and the noise levels erupted in the stadium. The joy in the Parken stadium was unconfined when Andreas Christensen made the game all but safe for the Danes.(AP/Pool: Jonathan Nackstrand)Players and staff ran from everywhere to converge on Christensen near the corner flag, as the Danish crowd began to believe their team was safe.Three minutes later, any last doubts were erased, when Joakim Maehle made it four. As the final whistle blew, the noise peaked as the party kicked off in the stands and on the pitch.Fans embraced, players and coaches punched the air. Amid a cacophany of sound, the Danish team gathered themselves in the middle of the ground and did the now-familiar curtain call, where everyone stands in a line and holds hands, then dances forward and takes a bow. It was party time at Parken, as the Danish team took a curtain call for the ecstatic home fans after their win over Russia.(AP/Pool: Stuart Franklin)There was a mix of joy, pride and relief that the Danish story at Euro 2020 was not over.LoadingIn the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen after the match, the celebrations continued after the game.Danish journalist Gisle Thorsen tweeted a video of fans chanting, with a caption that translates as: "Nørrebro. It's going to be a long, beautiful night." When the fans and players take a breath tomorrow, they will begin to focus on Sunday morning, Australian time, when the Danes will take on Wales in Amsterdam for a place in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.In the meantime, however, everyone in Denmark, not to mention most football fans around the world, are happy that the team has something more to celebrate after a tough fortnight.

I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now but finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest. I really have the best life, I’ve got the best family, friends and job a guy can ask for.In the video, which comes during Pride Month, he continued: “I’m a pretty private person so I hope you guys know that I’m really not doing this for attention. I just think that representation and visibility are so important. I actually hope that like one day, videos like this and the whole coming out process are not necessary, but until then I am gonna do my best and do my part to cultivate a culture that’s accepting that’s compassionate.”Nassib, 28, also announced a $100,000 donation to the Trevor Project, which works to prevent suicides among LGBTQ+ youth in America.Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, applauded Nassib’s bravery in a statement. “The NFL family is proud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today. Representation matters,” Goodell said. The Raiders tweeted “Proud of you, Carl”.In an additional written statement posted alongside his video, Nassib wrote: “Sadly, I have agonized over this moment for the last 15 years. Only until recently, thanks to my family and friends … did it seem possible for me to say publicly and proudly that I’m gay.”“I am also incredibly thankful for the NFL, my coaches and fellow players for their support. I would not have been able to do this without them. I feel especially thankful to have had so much support when many who came before – and many even now – do not.”Entering his sixth NFL season, Nassib was a third-round draft pick in 2016 by the Cleveland Browns. He spent two seasons with the Browns (2016-17), followed by two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2018-19) before signing a three-year, $25.3m contract, including nearly $16.8m in guarantees, with the Raiders in March 2020.In 73 career games (37 starts), Nassib has 143 tackles (36 for loss), 20.5 sacks, 16 passes defensed, one interception, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.Nassib is on track to become the first openly gay player to play in a regular-season game. The defensive end Michael Sam came out as gay in 2014 before the St Louis Rams drafted him, but he did not make the final roster.“I hope everyone can understand that I am just one person,” Nassib concluded. “I am a lanky walk-on who is living his dream. I owe it to my team, coaches and Raider fans to be completely locked in and at my best for the upcoming season. Thank you everyone for your support. Happy Pride Month and Go Raiders.”TopicsLas Vegas RaidersNFLUS sportsLGBT rightsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on WhatsAppShare on MessengerView on theguardian.comShow moreShow moreShow moreShow moreAbout usContact usComplaints and correctionsSecuredropWork for usPrivacy settingsPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersModern Slavery ActDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterAdvertise with usSearch jobsPatronsDiscount CodesSupport The GuardianContributeSubscribeBack to top© 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)Frank Clark was arrested in Los Angeles Sunday night after police say they found an Uzi firearm in his car.L.A. Police Department spokesman Tony Im told reporters on Monday that officers pulled over the Kansas City Chiefs Pro Bowl defensive end for a vehicle code violation as he was driving his Lamborghini. During the stop, officers say they saw the weapon sticking out of a duffel bag. Clark was charged with felony possession of a concealed firearm and booked into a Los Angeles County jail facing a $35,000 bond. According to KMBC, Clark has since been released, as were three passengers in the car. Clark was reportedly arrested in March on gun chargeAfter news of Sunday's arrest broke, the Kansas City Star reported that Clark was arrested in March on another gun charge. According to the report, California Highway Patrol pulled over Clark and another man when their car did not display a front license plate as required by California law. Similar to Sunday's alleged incident, the routine traffic stop led to police finding a loaded handgun and rifle in the car. Clark was also released on $35,000 bond in that incident, according to the report.The Chiefs have not commented on the allegations. Clark has played six NFL seasons with the Chiefs and Seattle Seahawks. He joined the Chiefs in 2019 and made the Pro Bowl after both of his seasons in Kansas City. The Chiefs signed Clark to a five-year, $105 million contract with $62.3 million guaranteed after acquiring him from Seattle in 2019. Questions about prior arrest followed Clark to Kansas CityClark was previously arrested in 2014 on a domestic violence charge while he was a student-athlete at Michigan. He was kicked off the Michigan football team after that arrest. He eventually reached a plea deal on a disorderly conduct charge. Clark and the Chiefs faced questions about his domestic violence history when he joined the team in 2019.“I’ve had to learn to be a better teammate, a better person and better man in general," Clark said at the time. "You’ve got to own up to it and what you’ve done. I affected a lot of people.Story continues"It’s something I have to learn and grow from. It’s five years later, and I’m persistent, doing everything I have to do to continue to speak out and be an advocate. I can barely hide, it’s all out there. Everyone’s gonna get a chance to know me.”Clark was also arrested in 2012 on a charge of stealing a laptop from a dorm room. He served a year's probation for that charge.

Video / InstagramCarl Nassib becomes first active NFL player to come out as gay. Video / InstagramAPLas Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib today became the first active NFL player to come out as gay.Nassib, who is entering his sixth NFL season and second with the Raiders, announced the news on Instagram, saying he wasn't doing it for the attention but because he felt representation and visibility were important."I just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I'm gay," Nassib said in his video message from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. "I've been meaning to do this for a while now, but I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest."I really have the best life. I got the best family, friends and job a guy can ask for. I'm a pretty private person, so I hope you guys know that I'm really not doing this for attention. I just think that representation and visibility are so important."AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Nassib added in a written message that followed the video that he "agonised over this moment for the last 15 years" and only recently decided to go public with his sexuality after receiving the support of family and friends."I am also incredibly thankful for the NFL, my coaches, and fellow players for their support," Nassib wrote. "I would not have been able to do this without them. From the jump I was greeted with the utmost respect and acceptance."Nassib added that he was donating US$100,000 to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent suicides among LGBTQ youth."The NFL family is proud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. "Representation matters. We share his hope that someday soon statements like his will no longer be newsworthy as we march toward full equality for the LGBTQ+ community. We wish Carl the best of luck this coming season."Nassib's announcement was greeted by Brian Burke, president of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins. Burke has been a major proponent of LGBTQ rights for more than a decade since his late son Brendan came out as gay."Proud to support Carl and his decision to come out as the first active gay player in the NFL," Burke said. "I hope other sports executives will join me in publicly expressing their support as well."More than a dozen NFL players have come out as gay after their careers were over.Former University of Missouri defensive star Michael Sam was the first openly gay football player ever selected in the NFL draft, going in the seventh round to the then-St. Louis Rams in 2014. But he never made the final roster and retired in 2015 having never played in an NFL regular-season game.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Nassib is a sixth-year pro who was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in 2016 in the third round (65th overall) out of Penn State. He played two seasons for the Browns and two for Tampa Bay before joining the Raiders in 2020.

(Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images)Tokyo Olympics organisers have gone against advice from top medical professionals and allowed fans to attend the upcoming Games.Organisers announced on Monday that 50% of venue capacity will be allowed at Tokyo Olympics venues, with a cap of 10,000 spectators.GAME-CHANGER: First photos emerge inside Tokyo Olympics village'DISASTER': Olympic athlete tests positive for Covid in JapanThe announcement ends months of speculation and highlights Japan's determination to push on with the Games and salvage the multi-billion-dollar extravaganza.However there has been much public opposition and deep concern about a resurgence in Covid-19 infections.Last week a number of top medical experts said holding the event without fans was the least risky option, while the head of a Japanese doctors' union said holding the Games could lead to the emergence of an "Olympic" coronavirus strain.Japan has largely avoided the kind of explosive coronavirus outbreaks that have devastated other countries, but the vaccine roll-out was initially slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in some places.Just 5% of the population is said to be vaccinated.Organisers also announced that cheering will be prohibited, masks will be required and spectators will be requested to travel directly to venues and go straight home afterwards.Numbers could be further reduced after July 12, depending on whether "quasi emergency" Covid-19 measures, due to expire the day before, are extended - or due to any other anti-infection measures in force at the time.Spectators from overseas have already been banned. The national stadium, built for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and due to host athletics and soccer this time, would have held 68,000 fans but will now be at a sliver of that.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Backlash over decision to allow fans at Tokyo OlympicsSome of the country's top health experts on Friday said banning spectators would be the least risky option.Story continues"I am concerned not just about the increase in the number of people coming to watch the Olympics itself but also about the loosening of people's sense of urgency by hosting the Olympics with spectators," Haruka Sakamoto, a physician and researcher at Keio University, told Reuters before the decision.Naoto Ueyama, head of the Japan Doctors Union, previously said there was a possibility that the Olympics could lead to a new strain of coronavirus."All of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in Tokyo. We cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging," he told a news conference."If such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a Tokyo Olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism, even for 100 years."Seiko Hashimoto, President of Tokyo 2020, speaks during a press conference to decide on fan attendance at the Olympics. (Photo by RODRIGO REYES MARIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)A recent public survey revealed 65% of the public want the event postponed again or cancelled, while nearly 70% said they thought the Games would not be held safely and securely.However events with spectators have already been happening in Japan in recent months.Some 7,600 fans attended a Yakult Swallows pro baseball game in Tokyo on Sunday."Spectators will come from various places and enter the venue, possibly leading to an influx of people and clusters, so this is a concern if that happens," said 48-year-old IT worker Masahiro Gomi."However, it seems like sports such as baseball are taking place as usual so I think 10,000 spectators may be alright."IOC President Thomas Bach said the vaccination rate for athletes and officials residing in the Olympic village was now "well above 80%", exceeding the IOC's initial expectations.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he would not rule out holding the Olympics without spectators if the capital was under a state of emergency."In the event a state of emergency was declared then we can't rule out not having spectators," he told reporters during a tour of vaccination sites in Tokyo on Monday.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.with ReutersWatch 'Mind Games', the new series from Yahoo Sport Australia exploring the often brutal mental toil elite athletes go through in pursuit of greatness:Click here to sign up to our newsletter for all the latest and breaking stories from Australia and around the world.TRENDING 1.

And when you’re in a situation where you’re looking for support, you’re looking for teammates to wrap their arms around you, you’re looking for a nation to get behind you and show support, there is no greater environment than the Australian Olympic basketball teams.“That’s a culture that’s been handed down from generation to generation to generation and, regardless of whatever personal situation they have, Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, all the other players involved in the Australian team, they will wrap their arms around Ben Simmons like no other because that is the culture of the Boomers.”Simmons was to have been a central plank to Australia’s quest for a breakthrough men’s Olympic medal but his underwhelming contribution against the Hawks prompted all manner of stinging criticism, and may ultimately lead to his Boomers’ omission.Amidst the fallout of defeat, 76ers coach Doc Rivers said he did not know whether the former No.1 pick could be a point guard on championship side, teammate Joel Embiid said Simmons’ decision to not complete an open dunk late in game seven was the “turning point” of the game, while the media pile-on has been ruthless on a man set to make $33 million next season.LoadingWhile Simmons was a unanimous selection on the NBA’s all defensive team this season and is a three-time All Star, his unwillingness to shoot the ball has been an issue for many years, and was put further under the spotlight against the Hawks when he took only three combined shots in seven final quarters, including none in the fourth quarters of the final four games. He averaged only 9.9 points per game against the Hawks.He has been criticised for not developing his game, whether that be having confidence to shoot three-pointers or from mid-range. He relies on dunks, fast breaks, tip ins and jump hooks to score.Simmons is also likely to be the subject of more trade speculation, for the 76ers had discussed trading him for former league Most Valuable Players James Harden through the season but the Brooklyn Nets ultimately satisfied the Houston Rockets in that deal.But coach Rivers said he was confident Simmons could do the work required to turn his game around.“I believe, without going into detail with what we’re doing, I believe we know what the right work is, and the right type of work, and the right way to do it,” Rivers said.“You can do the work all the time. But if it’s not done in the right way and the right type of work, you may not improve. After being here for a year, I really do believe we’ve identified what and how, and now we have to do the do part. We have to work to do it. It’s not going to be an easy job. But it’s definitely a job that Ben can do.”Sports news, results and expert commentary.

Asked why he'd waited six days before reporting the incident to police, MacGill said he "wasn't thinking particularly clearly" at the time.He said the ordeal had cost him his business and had taken a heavy toll on his personal life. "We have lost friends, we have lost family," he said.

Walsh replaced Valentine Holmes at No.1, with Holmes then moved into Coates' wing position."To me, that's huge. If he's not in the best two wingers in Queensland, then I'm a very, very poor judge," Sterling said on Wide World of Sports' Sterlo's Wrap."Obviously his club side [Brisbane] is struggling and maybe there was some defensive issues in game one but to be honest, I thought he'd be one of their first players chosen."Xavier Coates (C) was dropped by Queensland for Origin II. (Getty)Coates was terrorised by Latrell Mitchell and Brian To'o while defending on the right wing, with the NSW centre/wing pair scoring a combined four tries. However, he was a breakout star of Queensland's shock series win last year, scoring in his first two matches.Debutant winger Kyle Feldt also had a tough outing for Queensland in Origin I, yet kept his spot for Sunday's must-win game two in Brisbane. Cronulla winger Ronaldo Mulitalo was named 19th man, in a further snub to Coates."Kyle Feldt probably was a little bit fortunate there," Sterling said.Xavier Coates and Brian To'o of compete for the ball during game one of the State of Origin series. (Getty)All eyes will be on Walsh when Origin II kicks off. The Warriors fullback has played just seven NRL games, making him the second-least experienced player in Queensland Origin history."Big ask for a young man but he's obviously revelled in the pressure of NRL football," Sterling said."Now he's got to take that into a bigger stage. It will be a crowd that will make it much easier for him but you've still got to get the job done."For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!nrlState of Originqueensland maroonsPeter SterlingLink in BioMore NRL NewsPreviousThe Mole: Sydney Roosters mourning death of 1974 premiership player Harry CameronNextEXCLUSIVE: Reece Walsh Maroons debut mirrors fatal Origin mistakes of the past, says Peter SterlingMost PopularBrutal axing that haunted NSW for 15 years Bombshell dispute threatens Gallen-Huni fightFootball megastar nearing $155m flopOnline Coupons and Best DealsEdenSearch properties in AUSTop Utes!NineSearchSearchCareersAdvertise with usHelpTerms of usePrivacy© 2021 Nine Digital Pty Ltd© 2021 Nine Digital Pty Ltd
