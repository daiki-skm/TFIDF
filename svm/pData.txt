Representatives of local traders and sellers described the proposed norms as a step to “purify” the e-commerce landscape of the country. Written by Pranav Mukul | New Delhi | Updated: June 22, 2021 7:34:18 am On the lines of IT intermediary rules, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has proposed to mandate e-commerce companies to appoint a grievance officer, a chief compliance officer, and a nodal contact person “for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies”. THE MINISTRY of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has initiated sweeping changes to the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, imposing new registration requirements for online retailers and a ban on “specific” flash sales — and mandating sharing of information with Government agencies.The draft rules released Monday are broadly in line with the IT intermediary rules announced for social media companies earlier this year. Representatives of local traders and sellers described the proposed norms as a step to “purify” the e-commerce landscape of the country.According to the new provisions, e-commerce companies would need to register with the Department of Promotion for Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). They would also have to share information with the “Government agency, which is lawfully authorised for investigative or protective or cyber security activities, for the purposes of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution, of offences under any law for the time being in force, or for cyber security incidents”.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.pngThey propose that the information sought by the Government agency will have to be produced by the e-commerce company “within 72 hours of the receipt of an order from the said authority”.On the lines of IT intermediary rules, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has proposed to mandate e-commerce companies to appoint a grievance officer, a chief compliance officer, and a nodal contact person “for 24×7 coordination with law enforcement agencies”.In February, the Centre brought out a set of rules mandating social media companies to appoint officials and laying down requirements such as providing traceability of content originators. These intermediary rules have been challenged in the Delhi High Court by messaging platform WhatsApp, which has said that they are violative of user privacy.Top News Right NowGupkar coalition meets today as NC, Sajad Lone welcome ‘good change’Sharad Pawar to host meeting of Oppn parties todayPNB Housing can hold EGM but concern in Govt over its Rs 4000-crore Carlyle dealClick here for more The Government had notified the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules on July 23, 2020, for online retailers registered in India or abroad but offering goods and services to Indian consumers. Any violation of these rules attract penal action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.While the original rules focused on aspects such as transparency about product information to help consumers make informed decisions, the amendments aim to curb the circumventing of other laws. The Ministry has sought comments and views from stakeholders on the proposed amendments by July 6.The rules are applicable for all goods and services bought or sold over digital or electronic networks, including digital products. They are valid for all models of e-commerce, including marketplace and inventory models, including multi-channel single brand retailers and single brand retailers.Furthermore, to make the existing e-commerce norms more stringent, the Ministry is looking to ensure that these firms do not use data collected through their business for “unfair advantage” and prevent any possible links they may have with traders selling goods and services on their platforms. On this front, the Government has called for disallowing “specific flash sales” on e-commerce platforms.Issuing a statement, the Consumer Affairs Ministry said: “Conventional e-commerce flash sales are not banned. Only specific flash sales or back-to-back sales which limit customer choice, increase prices and prevents a level playing field are not allowed.”A “flash sale” is defined as a sale organised by an e-commerce entity at significantly reduced prices, high discounts or any other such promotions or attractive offers for a predetermined period of time.Additionally, the proposed rules also look to add to the Centre’s push behind domestic goods. They propose that e-commerce firms should mention the name and details of any importer from whom it has purchased such goods or services. These firms will also have to provide alternative suggestions to customers before they make a purchase “to ensure fair opportunity for domestic goods”.The Confederation of All India Traders, a body representing local traders and sellers who have been opposing practices by major e-commerce firms like Amazon and Flipkart, said in a statement: “The new draft is a guiding stone to purify the e-commerce landscape of the country, which has been greatly vitiated by various e-commerce global companies…”.In December 2018, the Industry Department had published changes to its foreign direct investment policy for e-commerce to tighten loopholes exploited by online marketplaces in previous policies announced by the Centre. These included curbing marketplaces from exercising control over inventory and restricting the relationship between the marketplace and sellers on its platform.In the proposed amendments to e-commerce norms, the Government is looking at bolstering these aspects by mandating that no logistics service provider of a marketplace e-commerce entity shall provide differentiated treatment between sellers of the same category. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Spirulina Market Worth $968.6 Million by 2028, Growing at a CAGR of 13.2% From 2021 - Exclusive Report by Meticulous Research® & EABASpirulina Market by Distribution Channel (Consumer Channel, Business Channel), Product Type (Powder, Tablets, Capsules, Flakes, Phycocyanin Extract), Application (Nutraceuticals, Food and Beverages, Agriculture, Animal Feed) - Global Forecast to 2028June 21, 2021 21:30 ET | Source: Meticulous Market Research Pvt. Ltd.Meticulous Market Research Pvt. Ltd. Pune, INDIA Pune, India, June 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a new market research report titled “Spirulina Market by Distribution Channel (Consumer Channel, Business Channel), Product Type (Powder, Tablets, Capsules, Flakes, Phycocyanin Extract), Application (Nutraceuticals, Food and Beverages, Agriculture, Animal Feed) - Global Forecast to 2028”, published by Meticulous Research®, the spirulina market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% from 2021 to 2028 to reach $968.6 million by 2028. In terms of volume, the spirulina market is expected to register a CAGR of 18.1% from 2021 to 2028 to reach 98,768.5 tons by 2028. Download Free Sample Report Now @ https://www.meticulousresearch.com/download-sample-report/cp_id=5070 The growth of this market is mainly attributed to the rising health & wellness trends and dietary supplements industry; growing demand for natural food colors; increasing vegetarianism; stringent regulations regarding the inclusion of synthetic colors and flavors; growing malnutrition; increasing preference for spirulina sourced products, especially omega-3 fatty acids; growing use of spirulina in aquaculture; rising investments from leading color houses; and increasing number of products that include spirulina as ingredient. However, low awareness about the benefits of spirulina and challenges associated with spirulina production is expected to hinder the growth of the global spirulina market to some extent. The spirulina market studied in this report is majorly segmented by distribution channel (business and consumer channel), product type (powder, tablets, capsules, flakes, phycocyanin extract, and frozen spirulina), and application (nutraceuticals, food & beverages, animal feed, cosmetics, and agriculture), and geography (Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa). The study also evaluates industry competitors and analyzes the market at the country level. Based on the distribution channel, the spirulina market is mainly segmented into consumer and business channels. In terms of value and volume, in 2021, the business channel segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall spirulina market. The large share of this segment is mainly attributed to the direct purchase of bulk spirulina in large quantities by various manufacturers such as nutraceuticals, food and beverages, and animal feed, among others, for further product development. Speak to our Analysts to Understand the Impact of COVID-19 on Your Business: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/speak-to-analyst/cp_id=5070 Based on the product type, the spirulina market is mainly segmented into powder, tablets, capsules, flakes, phycocyanin extracts, and frozen spirulina. In terms of value, in 2021, the spirulina powder segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall spirulina market. The large share of this segment is mainly attributed to its rising demand from nutraceutical manufacturers due to the growing health consciousness among consumers and the increasing use of spirulina powder as an ingredient in various F&B products. Based on application, the spirulina market is mainly divided into nutraceuticals, food and beverages, agriculture, animal feed, and cosmetics. In terms of value, in 2021, the nutraceuticals segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall spirulina market. The large share of this segment is mainly attributed to the booming nutraceuticals sector, growing health concerns of the aging population in various countries, growing desire for natural alternatives to traditional pharmaceutical products, and increased awareness among consumers on the link between nutrition and health. However, the food & beverages segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, owing to the growing demand for spirulina natural food color in confectionery products (including candy and chewing gum), frostings, ice cream and frozen desserts, dessert coatings and toppings, beverage mixes and powders, yogurts, custards, puddings, cottage cheese, gelatin, breadcrumbs, and ready-to-eat cereals. Quick Buy – Spirulina Market Research Report: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/Checkout/90366580 Based on geography, the global spirulina market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. In terms of value, North America is estimated to account for the largest share of the global spirulina market in 2021, followed by the Asia-Pacific, and Europe, owing to the huge consumption of health supplements; strict regulations against the use of synthetic colors; growth of subsidiary industries like cosmetics and biofertilizers; increasing preference for natural protein sources; and presence of key spirulina manufacturers with huge production capacities, especially in the U.S. However, Europe is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period, mainly due to the increased adoption of phycocyanin in the manufacturing of therapeutic & nutritional products, growing reluctance towards the usage of synthetic colors, rising demand for natural blue colorants, and investments from leading color houses in the phycocyanin space. The key players operating in the global spirulina market are Earthrise Nutritional, LLC (U.S.), DIC Corporation (Japan), Yunnan Green A Bio-engineering Co., Ltd (China), Algene Biotech (India), Tianjin Norland Biotech Co., Ltd. (China), Cyanotech Corporation (U.S.), E.I.D. Parry (I) Ltd. (India), Far East Biotech Co. Ltd., (China), Fuqing King Dnarmsa Spirulina Co., Ltd.

But, at the same time, it creates a tonne of impact for millions of people.Kevin Aluwico-founder and CEO, GojekSoutheast Asia is home to a large, youthful population eager to embrace new technologies. Indonesia alone boasts the world's fourth-largest population with a median age of 29.7.But more than that, with much of the region still in its development stage, there are huge opportunities for start-ups to create real-life solutions for society, said Aluwi."What's really unique and great about Indonesia and Southeast Asia [is] there's actually a deep alignment between what's good for business and also what's good for society," he said.Kevin Aluwi, co-founder and CEO of Indonesian ride-hailing platform Gojek, part of GoTo Group.GoTo GroupAs such, when starting Gojek, Aluwi sought to support Indonesia's millions of previously marginalized motorbike taxi drivers — known as ojeks — by connecting them with frequent, on-demand jobs such as ride-hailing, food delivery and courier services."The fact of the matter is, the biggest opportunity is in the informal economy; very different from maybe more developed economies," he added.'Time travel' as a success strategyIt's an observation that has seen the company, under the wider GoTo umbrella, establish itself as a key player in Indonesia's economy. Today, the group says it contributes 2% to Indonesia's $1.1 trillion GDP through its on-demand, e-commerce and financial services products."It speaks to the opportunity in Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia that we get to build these very large, fast-growing platforms. But, at the same time, it creates a ton of impact for millions of people at the bottom of the pyramid," said Aluwi.We kind of have this time travel machine; you can learn and draw inspiration from around the world.William Tanuwijayaco-founder and CEO, TokopediaYet, Aluwi acknowledged that companies like his own have also benefited from the region's initial delay in digital adoption, allowing them to capitalize on the smartphone era."What we see in developing economies is that there is an opportunity to leapfrog," he said. "When there isn't as established products and services and habits that might have been more ingrained in more developed economies, there's an opportunity to jump straight into better and newer technologies."William Tanuwijaya, co-founder and CEO of Tokopedia, part of Indonesian tech giant GoTo.GoToIt's a concept Aluwi's counterpart at Tokopedia refers to as "time travel." Having started his e-commerce company in 2009, during the advent of the internet in Indonesia, William Tanuwijaya was able to look to successful internet pioneers in advanced economies and follow their lead in his home market."We have the benefit of growing a technology company in an emerging market, so we kind of have this time travel machine; you can learn and draw inspiration from around the world," he said.Beware the 'allure' of entrepreneurshipYet, despite the burgeoning opportunities for Southeast Asia's business owners, Aluwi warned against the "allure" of entrepreneurship, which can attract people to it for the wrong reasons."There are all these things that attract people to it," he said. "But, to me, these are the outcomes of actually figuring out and focusing on specific problems and delivering great products to solve those problems."Building a company is hard and often frustrating, he said, and aspiring entrepreneurs need to be sure they're willing to deal with the failures, as well as the wins."Not falling in love with the problem and obsessing over the solution means that the ups and downs of building a company are probably not something that most people will persevere through," he added.

DestinationsFood & DrinkNewsStayVideoSearchMenuFood & DrinkWhat are floating breakfasts, and why have they become so popular? Lilit Marcus, CNN • Published 22nd June 2021FacebookTwitterEmail(CNN) — If you follow luxury resorts or travel influencers on Instagram, odds are good that you've seen at least one "floating breakfast."In case you're not familiar with them, here's what to know: they're your typical upscale hotel room service breakfast -- think toast, fruit, coffee and the like -- served in a pool or hot tub instead of in bed. Usually, they're placed on large platters or colorful baskets, then accessorized with bright tropical flowers to make them even more photogenic.These breakfasts are particularly popular in Asia and the Pacific, especially at warm-weather private villa resorts in places like Thailand, Fiji and the Maldives. Nearly everyone agrees that the trend began in Bali, although no specific resort seems to get the credit for coming up with the idea first. Gorgeous scenery plus yummy food equals perfect social media bait.ShutterstockWhile these breakfasts have become more common on resort menus over the last five years, the coronavirus pandemic has made them more popular than ever as hotel guests are avoiding buffets and communal dining rooms."Across the course of the past year, in-suite dining has become extremely popular, especially for those seeking solace in the safety and comfort of their suite," Jann Hess, general manager at Amanjiwo in Bali, tells CNN Travel. "The floating breakfast is a popular choice."After all, the floating breakfast needs a pool to float in -- and a private plunge pool is a much better choice than a shared pool where a splashing kid might make the whole thing topple over.Beyond the 'gramThough the gorgeous colors and dramatic plating of floating breakfasts make them perfect for social media, asking people to stand in the pool before they've fully woken up or had caffeine seems like a potential recipe for disaster. Are these breakfasts just made to be shared online and discarded, or do people genuinely enjoy eating them?James Booth, a Sydney-based reporter for DMarge.com, admits to wondering the same thing before trying one at an upscale resort in Bali in 2019.He tells CNN Travel that, for him, the lush meal worked better in concept than in execution. Though Booth had pre-scheduled a specific time for the breakfast to arrive, he ended up oversleeping about 20 minutes, meaning he'd missed the optimal window for consuming it.

Although the food was already getting cold, he was determined to get an Instagram shot of the fancy setup before chowing down. The hotel's staff had wisely placed the trays in a separate section of the pool, but he moved them into the larger area in order to stage the scene. That ended up in trays floating off in different directions and him, still bleary-eyed, trying to corral it all. "I was too embarrassed to ask for help," he confesses, "so I spilled everything everywhere. The coffee had a bit of pool water in it, and the bread was soggy."Still, Booth is careful to pin the blame on himself and not on the resort employees who organized the meal. "I think it's a bit violent to jump in the water first thing when you wake up," he says. If he were going to do the experience over again, he'd make a couple of changes, namely drinking the coffee first so he'd be alert enough not to knock anything over and finding a spot in the pool where he could sit down to eat instead of have to stand around awkwardly.Floating the ideaThe floating breakfast has quickly become yet another luxury hotel amenity, like afternoon tea or a turndown treat. Amid the pandemic, domestic travelers taking advantage of affordable staycations have also embraced floating breakfasts. Timo Kuenzli, general manager of Koh Samui's all-pool-villa Cape Fahn Hotel, says that nearly 100% of their guests over the past year have ordered one. "We can definitely see that the Asian market is way more into having Instagrammable moments to capture than other markets," he says. In addition to the photos being beautiful, they also serve as a free marketing tool -- people see the breakfasts online, check out the location tag, and then want to get in on the experience themselves when they stay at Cape Fahn later.

The Six Senses Uluwatu in Bali (pictured above) serves theirs in a red heart-shaped basket. The Anantara in Koh Phangan, Thailand, has a floating "sunset sushi" extravaganza. Cape Fahn is working on a floating afternoon tea experience. Regardless of your personal opinion on the merits of Instagram-centric hotel offerings, it looks like these floating meals have gone from fad to mainstay. Just remember to drink the coffee first.

Updated: 22 Jun 2021, 06:44 AM IST Bloomberg With coronavirus-induced restrictions now largely lifted across the country, companies are taking different approaches to retain staff and boost productivity Read Full Story Bumble Inc., the dating and relationship app where women have to make the first move, temporarily closed its offices this week, giving its about 700 employees a “much-needed break" to recover from Covid burnout. With coronavirus-induced restrictions now largely lifted across the country, companies are taking different approaches to retain staff and boost productivity. Some expect a full return to the office while others are offering a more flexible approach. MORE FROM THIS SECTIONSee All Premium Premium Amazon could be forced to sell logistics business under ....

Corporations such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are requiring all vaccinated employees to come back to the office by the fall, whereas Apple Inc. will pursue a hybrid work-from-home strategy and Twitter Inc. has said many employees will be able to work from home indefinitely. During the pandemic, dating apps had to quickly pivot to keep users engaged as people isolated and quarantined at home. In-person dates went virtual as Zoom happy hours, Netflix parties and online coffee dates filled after-hours schedules. As the pandemic forced people out of offices and schools, fears of Zoom fatigue and burnout emerged as the boundary between work and home vanished. While many businesses have thrived, many of their workers are on the edge of throwing in the towel. A Microsoft Corp. study this spring found that 41% of workers may quit this year. With employers at risk of losing employees, the ball is now in workers’ courts as they are now in a position to leverage change. The paid vacation for Bumble staff -- and employees at its Latin American unit Badoo -- comes amid a trend of bosses persuading employees that they have their best interests at heart and to stay. Citigroup Inc. announced in March that it would ban Zoom calls on Fridays to combat burnout. Return-to-work incentives are also present in the restaurant service sector, which is struggling to find workers. White Castle boosted its starting pay in some cities to $15 from $11.50, including free meals during shifts, while Wendy’s is offering a $100 signing bonus.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of equity sales Vincent Lau said the finalisation of the deal is indeed “good news” for the market, considering the uncertain economic environment currently. “It’s finally happened and that’s a good thing, considering all that’s happening right now as the country is tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. “The merger will create synergies for the parties to cut down on costs and allow them to leverage each other’s brands for long-term growth,” he told StarBiz. Following the completion of a due diligence exercise, Axiata, Telenor and Digi announced yesterday they had signed transaction agreements for the merger. The proposed merger is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2022, subject to the relevant approvals.

VIDEO3:1603:16Asia needs to get Covid 'under control' before Fed rate hikes: Moody's AnalyticsSquawk Box AsiaAsian countries have to tame the current waves of the coronavirus outbreak in order to get their economies ready for future rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, an economist said Monday.Fed officials last week indicated that interest rate hikes could come as soon as 2023, shifting from earlier comments in March that said the U.S. central bank was not expecting any increases until at least 2024.Higher U.S. rates would lure investors from abroad, and central banks in other countries may have to raise their own rates in defense. Raising interest rates could help countries prevent too much capital from leaving their economies, but increasing rates too quickly heightens the risk of an economic slowdown."Asian countries have to get Covid under control so that once the Federal Reserve does begin raising interest rates, the economies here are in good stead and can manage the transition as well," Steve Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia." Cochrane predicted that the U.S. central bank might raise interest rates by 25 basis points once every quarter starting 2023. The so-called dot plot of individual Fed member expectations pointed to two hikes that year.Asian countries have to get Covid under control so that once the Federal Reserve does begin raising interest rates, the economies here are in good stead and can manage the transition as well.Steve CochraneChief APAC economist, Moody's AnalyticsMany economies in Asia including Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia have in recent months seen a renewed surge in Covid cases — which forced authorities to impose stricter social-distancing measures. The fresh waves of infections come as vaccination progress in the region lags that of the U.S. and Europe.The World Bank said in a report this month that economic output in two-thirds of East Asia and Pacific countries will remain below pre-pandemic levels until 2022. Factors that dampen potential economic growth in those countries include extended Covid outbreaks and a collapse in global tourism, said the bank.VIDEO2:1602:16Emerging markets look 'interesting' as Fed tapering expectations grow: UBSStreet Signs AsiaCochrane pointed out that Covid outbreaks across the region are "staunching" domestic demand and keeping inflation moderate.The economist said several Asian countries including China, South Korea and Singapore are ramping up Covid vaccinations. "That's looking good but that has to continue going forward," he said.But other countries including Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have not effectively controlled the outbreak and don't have strong vaccination programs yet, added Cochrane.— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Picture: NCA NewsWire / Emma BrasierSource:News Corp AustraliaSydney motorists will start to feel the ugly hangover from a cheap year of fuel prices with petrol about to soar across the city.Fuel experts from the NRMA have warned drivers in the Harbour City to fill up now before petrol prices climb from an average of $1.41 a litre, which is up 5 cents from last week, to an estimated $1.62 in coming days and weeks.“We are at the beginning of a new fuel cost cycle,” NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury told NCA NewsWire.“We enjoyed cheap fuel for most of last year due to less global demand, but that is about to change, unfortunately, for motorists.”The price hike is a result of Singapore Mogas 95 – the benchmark that determines Australian fuel costs – trading at about $80 a barrel, a 21-month high.The strengthening of the Aussie dollar as the economy recovers from Covid-19 and increased demand as more people return to offices are also driving up prices, according to Mr Khoury.Across Sydney, unleaded 91 prices are beginning to soar in selected service stations, according to NSW government website fuelcheck.nsw.gov.au.Fuel prices are set to rise across Sydney.

Here's whyChina is cracking down -- again.Daniel Van BoomJune 21, 2021 5:27 p.m. PT Listen - 02:38 Chesnot/Getty One day you're on top of the world, making headlines for your upcoming appearance on SNL. Not long after, you're the laughing stock of the internet. That's the curse of DogeCoin which, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum and pretty much every other cryptocurrency, tumbled in value on Monday. DogeCoin is down more than 30%, to 17.6 cents. That's a huge fall from its stratospheric high of 70 cents back in April. Bitcoin is at $31,500, a fall of just over 10%, while Ethereum has crumbled 15%. Ether's fall has affected thousands of altcoins, most of which are built off the Ethereum blockchain and have a chunk of their value weighted in Ether coins. The entire market is down 12%, according to CoinBase.Editors' top picksSubscribe to CNET Now for the day's most interesting reviews, news stories and videos.What's the reason? China -- again. Back in May, Chinese officials reaffirmed an old ban that forbids financial firms from actively aiding in the mining and selling of cryptocurrencies. It caused a big dip, but crypto enthusiasts shrugged that the ban is nothing new, that it had enshrined in 2013 and then sparsely enforced. Everything is down. CoinBase On Monday, however, moves made by China indicated the law would be enforced much more seriously. Key banks and financial services companies like Alipay attended a meeting by China's central bank, reports the South China Morning Post, where they were told to crackdown on cryptocurrency trading. It came days after regional authorities ordered the closure of 26 mining operations in Sichuan."Virtual currency transactions and speculative activity have disrupted the normal order of the economy and financial [system]," the central bank said in a statement on its website. "They increase the risks of illegal cross-border transfers of assets and illegal activities such as money laundering. "The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency is anathema to the Chinese Communist Party's focus on stability -- and control. Though shunning Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, China is working on rolling out its very own digital currency, the e-yuan.China’s #bitcoin ban is short-term negative, long-term positive— Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) June 21, 2021The dominant driver of #Bitcoin right now is the crackdown on mining & trading in China that began in May. This created a forced & rushed exodus of Chinese capital & mining from the Bitcoin network - a tragedy for China and a benefit for the Rest of the World over the long term.— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) June 19, 2021China banned Google in 2010…#bitcoin pic.twitter.com/othsED1Qg6— Paul Knight 🌞 🌑 🌎 🟩 (@PLK5280) June 21, 2021Bitcoin enthusiasts are comparing the cryptocurrency to Google, whose share price continued to flourish after being banned in the People's Republic back in 2010. They say that China neglects cryptocurrencies to its own peril, and that this will be a long-term positive for the US.DOGE coin holders right now. pic.twitter.com/eJyNfO8edW— Mutahar (@OrdinaryGamers) June 21, 2021If I can HODL you can HODL! #dogecoin pic.twitter.com/ukDrXrwbqf— greg (@greg16676935420) June 21, 2021DogeCoin holders are less tranquil. The memecoin entered the year being valued at less than a cent and was pumped by Elon Musk and an ironic internet movement hoping to boost it to 10 cents -- similar to the movement trying to get GameStop's stock to $1,000. The 10 cent target was met in April, and then throroughly eclipsed in the month that followed. With hype building around a potential announcement from Musk at SNL, the memecoin hit 73 cents. After Musk referred to DogeCoin as "a hustle" on the show, its value plummeted, a trend that's continued for the past month.

Janie BarrettSeven also said it had 24.19 per cent of Boral. The offer, which was made on May 10, is scheduled to close on June 30.But Boral on Tuesday continued to urge its 80,000 shareholders to reject the offer. Boral chair Kathryn Fagg said in an announcement to the ASX the Boral independent board directors continued to believe the Seven offer “significantly undervalues your shares”. Boral said its shareholders should take no action.Relations between Seven and Boral became more strained on Monday when Seven Group accused Boral of rushing the sale of its North American building products business, which it sold for $2.9 billion to Westlake Chemical in a leap forward for chief executive Zlatko Todorcevski’s overhaul of the company.Related QuotesAdvertisementWestlake Chemical, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Houston, was one of five bidders for the assets that include roofing, stone and window businesses. Bank of America ran the sales process for Boral.Seven Group has marginally increased its stake by default since May 10 because Boral is ploughing on with a share buyback, which has the effect of shrinking the number of shares on issue. Boral has bought back large chunks of its own shares every day in the $700 million-plus buyback, which began in April.An independent expert’s report compiled by Grant Samuel in response to Seven’s takeover bid had a $US1.8 billion ($2.4 billion) to $US2 billion valuation range for the US building products business. In trading on the ASX on Monday, Boral shares closed 1.33 per cent higher at $6.87.Boral shares have remained consistently higher than the $6.50-per-share cash offer that Seven made on May 10.Mr Todorcevski said on June 10 that Boral’s 80,000 shareholders “deserve better” than a lowball and opportunistic offer from Seven designed to increase its influence over the company without paying fair value.A Seven spokeswoman said on Monday the sale by Boral of the US building products arm to Westlake “seems like a rushed sale process in response to our offer. Our view is that Boral should have secured more,” she said. She also said the US building products arm had been sold at a loss.Boral said in reply that the building products sale process had been announced in October 2020, almost seven months before Seven made the takeover offer.Jefferies analyst Simon Thackray said it was a robust price that Boral had received, and well in excess of his own valuation of about US$1.45 billion. “I think it’s a very good price for a bunch of disparate assets that were very loosely cobbled together in the US as a national business,” he said.Simon Evans writes on business specialising in retail, manufacturing, beverages, mining and M&A.

BloombergAt his $US130 million ($172 million) fund LedgerPrime, filled with Wall Street converts from the likes of Virtu Financial and Cantor Fitzgerald, Tang is minting money trading derivatives on virtual tokens.The Bank of America and UBS Group alum is making markets in options and running systematic strategies like price arbitrage and momentum across exchanges. The reward: a 78 per cent return this year in his flagship fund.“The opportunity seemed larger given the inefficiencies,” said the chief investment officer in an interview from Miami. “There’s so much innovation and new products being launched in crypto.”AdvertisementFed by relentless demand for leverage and hedging strategies, the crypto derivatives complex is getting bigger, ever-more liquid and increasingly influential. With bitcoin still up around 250 per cent over the past year despite heart-stopping swings and the recent downslide, new venues of speculation from decentralised finance to futures contracts have exploded to meet the insatiable appetite to trade.Consider the options market. An average $US1.4 billion in notional amount changed hands every day last month at the largest options exchange Deribit, a nearly 13-fold jump from 2020. Open interest in bitcoin contracts now totals $US7 billion.And a growing cohort of money managers and retail traders are selling crypto options for yield -- a common strategy in mainstream assets and a sign the industry is growing up fast.Options change hands on the CME, the largest derivatives exchange in the world, in addition to more specialised venues like Binance, Huobi and LedgerPrime’s sister company, LedgerX. Even Goldman Sachs Group is mulling a move into Ether derivatives.AdvertisementGlorified casinoTo critics, it’s all a glorified, largely unregulated casino with little real-world utility that could easily come crashing down -- with Chinese regulatory curbs the latest threat.Yet in Tang’s telling, the industry bears similarities to his old stomping grounds on Wall Street, with tried-and-tested systematic strategies in stocks and bonds gaining popularity in the world of virtual currencies. Like traditional market-makers, Tang’s firm posts bid and ask quotes on options venues and makes money from the spread, which tends to be wider in more volatile assets.Still, this is crypto, of course -- a wild west. Liquidations can happen before a trader has the chance to top up collateral. And there’s no central clearing house, so LedgerPrime needs to manage its positions at every venue individually. All this helps explain why bitcoin slid precipitously last month.“It’s not like they’ll slowly liquidate your positions -- they basically just market sell or market buy your leveraged positions and blast through the book,” Tang said, referring to the exchanges.For many, the mania is part of the appeal. New products appear so quickly that even as one inefficiency narrows, another soon materialises across one of the hundreds of exchanges out there. And all these opportunities are drawing a more professional crowd, with institutional investors representing some 80 per cent of flows on Deribit.AdvertisementA hot trend right now is selling options for yield in a wager that crypto price swings will be lower than the market has priced in. Since that’s akin to earning premiums on an insurance policy, it can be hugely profitable -- and risky -- with an asset like bitcoin.The token’s one-month implied volatility, a key variable in option pricing, trades around 100 and soared to as high as 165 in last month’s wipeout, according to Deribit. The S&P 500 equivalent right now? Around 18.Selling crypto options is proving especially lucrative as returns diminish in trades like the spot-futures basis.“In the absence of interesting yields for these alternatives, option strategies become more relevant,” said Deribit chief commercial officer Luuk Strijers.The upshot of all this is that option volumes are getting big enough to sway spot prices. Dealers like LedgerPrime buy underlying tokens to hedge their own exposure -- adding momentum to both rallies and retreats in what’s known as a gamma squeeze.Tang’s tip: Watch spot moves around 4am in New York every Friday, when most options contracts expire.“Option flow can definitely drive some of the shorter-term price action,” Tang said. “Longer-term, it’s still supply and demand.”BloombergSaveLog in or Subscribe to save articleShareIntroducing your NewsfeedFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.Find out moreRead MoreCryptocurrenciesDerivativesLatest StoriesLiveMarkets LiveASX rises; Nuix touches record lowASX extends morning gains; Washington H Soul Pattinson announces $10.8 billion Milton merger; Amundi warns of ‘stagflation’.11 mins agoAnalysisOpen bankingOpen banking’s first birthday is no cause for celebrationIt will be one year next week since big banks were forced to make customer data available via APIs but awareness and participation in the regime are very low.14 mins agoOpinionIPOInvestment banking’s next headacheThe SEC’s decision to liberalise the regulatory framework around direct listings presents an existential risk to the established model.30 mins agoRegulationBuddy Technologies admits funding ‘error’ as it eyes raisingThe suspended $130 million Buddy Technologies is planning a $6.5 million capital raising and trying to stretch out its bills to a Chinese company to remain a going concern. 36 mins agoSponsoredAdvertisementLatest In CurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBitcoin forms ‘death cross’ as sell-off shows no sign of reprieveJun 22, 2021Vildana HajricAussie dollarAussie dollar’s wild 24 hours throws forecasts into doubtJun 17, 2021Alex GluyasBitcoinBitcoin bounces on first protocol upgrade in four yearsJun 15, 2021Alex GluyasCryptocurrenciesBitcoin among riskiest assets: bank regulatorJun 11, 2021Silla BrushCryptocurrenciesEl Salvador first in world to make bitcoin legal tenderJun 10, 2021Nelson Renteria, Tom Wilson and Karin StroheckerMost Viewed In MarketsLiveASX rises; Nuix touches record lowASX to leap, Wall St rebounds on energy, financialsBitcoin forms ‘death cross’ as sell-off shows no sign of reprieveEx-Wall Street quants net 78pc return in crypto options boomOil advances most in a month with key oil spreads surgingThe next Baby Boomers are China’s MillennialsBefore phone cameras, this artistic chef drew the dishes he dined onPhilippa CoatesWho’s afraid of cruising?
