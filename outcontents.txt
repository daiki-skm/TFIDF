The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
productive.


Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
interpreted language.


Getting started
Installing Go

Instructions for downloading and installing Go.

Tutorial: Getting started

A brief Hello, World tutorial to get started. Learn a bit about Go code, tools, packages, and modules.

Tutorial: Create a module

A tutorial of short topics introducing functions, error handling, arrays, maps, unit testing, and compiling.

Writing Web Applications

Building a simple web application.

How to write Go code

This doc explains how to develop a simple set of Go packages inside a module,
and it shows how to use the go command
to build and test packages.



A Tour of Go


An interactive introduction to Go in three sections.
The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses
methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives.
Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've
learned. You can take the tour
online or install it locally with:


$ go get golang.org/x/tour


This will place the tour binary in your workspace's bin directory.

Using and understanding Go
Effective Go

A document that gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
A must read for any new Go programmer. It augments the tour and
the language specification, both of which should be read first.

Editor plugins and IDEs

A document that summarizes commonly used editor plugins and IDEs with
Go support.

Diagnostics

Summarizes tools and methodologies to diagnose problems in Go programs.

Managing dependencies

When your code uses external packages, those packages (distributed as modules) become dependencies.

Accessing databases
Tutorial: Accessing a relational database

Introduces the basics of accessing a relational database using Go and the
database/sql package in the standard library.

Accessing relational databases

An overview of Go's data access features.

Opening a database handle

You use the Go database handle to execute database operations. Once you open a
handle with database connection properties, the handle represents a connection
pool it manages on your behalf.

Executing SQL statements that don't return data

For SQL operations that might change the database, including SQL
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, you use
Exec methods.

Querying for data

For SELECT statements that return data from a query, using the
Query or QueryRow method.

Using prepared statements

Defining a prepared statement for repeated use can help your code run a bit
faster by avoiding the overhead of re-creating the statement each time your
code performs the database operation.

Executing transactions

sql.Tx exports methods representing transaction-specific semantics,
including Commit and Rollback, as well as methods you
use to perform common database operations.

Cancelling in-progress database operations

Using context.Context, you can
have your application's function calls and services stop working early and
return an error when their processing is no longer needed.

Managing connections

For some advanced programs, you might need to tune connection pool parameters
or work with connections explicitly.

Avoiding SQL injection risk

You can avoid an SQL injection risk by providing SQL parameter values as
sql package function arguments

Developing modules
Developing and publishing modules

You can collect related packages into modules, then publish the modules for other developers to use. This topic gives an overview of developing and publishing modules.

Module release and versioning workflow

When you develop modules for use by other developers, you can follow a workflow that helps ensure a reliable, consistent experience for developers using the module. This topic describes the high-level steps in that workflow.

Managing module source

When you're developing modules to publish for others to use, you can help ensure that your modules are easier for other developers to use by following the repository conventions described in this topic.

Developing a major version update

A major version update can be very disruptive to your module's users because it includes breaking changes and represents a new module. Learn more in this topic.

Publishing a module

When you want to make a module available for other developers, you publish it so that it's visible to Go tools. Once you've published the module, developers importing its packages will be able to resolve a dependency on the module by running commands such as go get.

Module version numbering

A module's developer uses each part of a module's version number to signal the version’s stability and backward compatibility. For each new release, a module's release version number specifically reflects the nature of the module's changes since the preceding release.

Talks

A Video Tour of Go

Three things that make Go fast, fun, and productive:
interfaces, reflection, and concurrency. Builds a toy web crawler to
demonstrate these.

Code that grows with grace

One of Go's key design goals is code adaptability; that it should be easy to take a simple design and build upon it in a clean and natural way. In this talk Andrew Gerrand describes a simple "chat roulette" server that matches pairs of incoming TCP connections, and then use Go's concurrency mechanisms, interfaces, and standard library to extend it with a web interface and other features. While the function of the program changes dramatically, Go's flexibility preserves the original design as it grows.

Go Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency is the key to designing high performance network services. Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) provide a simple and efficient means of expressing concurrent execution. In this talk we see how tricky concurrency problems can be solved gracefully with simple Go code.

Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns

This talk expands on the Go Concurrency Patterns talk to dive deeper into Go's concurrency primitives.

We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."Mr Tehan said he was "confident" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had "very positive discussions" with Ms Truss, the news.com.au website reported.image copyrightReutersimage captionFarmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operatorsIn 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at £20.1bn, and both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably.Currently, metals, wine and machines form the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia's main UK imports are cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks.Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would "have a massive impact" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations.She added: "We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."'Distinct advantages'The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed.And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was "strongly opposed" to ending tariffs and quotas.But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more "higher-end" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia.A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: "Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards."Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."Are you a farmer in the UK?

The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.8% in the three months to March, down from 4.9% in February, the Office for National Statistics said.The ONS said there were "early signs of recovery" in the jobs market,However, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020.The official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages.UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 yearsAre you currently unemployed? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.ukThe ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck.Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll "rose strongly in April" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough.But he said: "There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak."With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment."Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic."While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working."Business leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go.'I've applied for 500 jobs'As many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. Interior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed.She worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. "I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at," she told the BBC.She said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers."When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing."Although the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised."It destroys your confidence," she said. "I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs."You feel like you're stuck at square one."Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: "Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential."He added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June.Research consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was "insulating the labour market".The firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs.The most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were "at near pre-pandemic levels". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties.The jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month.The pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed.Are you currently unemployed?

"And while lenders are far more cautious than they were back in 2007, in this kind of market, there's still the risk buyers will lose their heads, and make a property mistake that could haunt them for years."'Huge inequalities'Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said the sharp rise in prices would mean fewer people were able to afford new homes."The effects are clear: with wages rising significantly more slowly than house prices, affordability constraints are increasing," she said."This is creating huge inequalities between older and younger generations, and growing demand from both younger and older renters who are priced out."For first-time buyers, this is a hideous market," she added. "With average prices up £24,000 in a year, saving a 10% deposit needs £2,400 extra in savings."image copyrightPA MediaTax breaksTax breaks introduced during the pandemic to boost the housing market had a marked effect over the period. The ONS report said: "Changes in the tax paid on housing transactions may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as the buyers' overall costs are reduced."A stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, which had been due to end in March, was recently extended.In Wales, a holiday on the equivalent tax has also been extended until the end of June 2021.A similar property transaction tax in Scotland ended on 31 March 2021."The extension of the stamp duty holiday helped ensure this won't be the last of the record months this year," said Sarah Coles.'Fear of missing out' fuels record house pricesUK housing market 'on the boil' as prices riseAverage house prices increased over the year in England to £275,000, a 10.2% annual increase.In Wales prices climbed 11% to £185,000, in Scotland 10.6% to £167,000 and in Northern Ireland they were up 6% to £149,000.In England, Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest annual house price growth, up 14% in the year to March.The lowest annual growth was in London, where average prices increased by 3.7% over the year.However, London's average house prices remained the most expensive of any region in the UK at an average of £500,000.Different propertyThe figures also suggested a switch in demand for different types of property.The average price of detached properties increased by 11.7% in the year to March 2021, while flats and maisonettes were up just 5.0% over the period."The demand for a new type of home, coupled with the government's mortgage guarantee scheme, will continue to support transaction levels in the months ahead, and potentially in the medium-term," said Andrew Montlake, managing director of independent mortgage broker Coreco.
