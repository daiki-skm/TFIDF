The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
productive.


Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
interpreted language.


Getting started
Installing Go

Instructions for downloading and installing Go.

Tutorial: Getting started

A brief Hello, World tutorial to get started. Learn a bit about Go code, tools, packages, and modules.

Tutorial: Create a module

A tutorial of short topics introducing functions, error handling, arrays, maps, unit testing, and compiling.

Writing Web Applications

Building a simple web application.

How to write Go code

This doc explains how to develop a simple set of Go packages inside a module,
and it shows how to use the go command
to build and test packages.



A Tour of Go


An interactive introduction to Go in three sections.
The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses
methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives.
Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've
learned. You can take the tour
online or install it locally with:


$ go get golang.org/x/tour


This will place the tour binary in your workspace's bin directory.

Using and understanding Go
Effective Go

A document that gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
A must read for any new Go programmer. It augments the tour and
the language specification, both of which should be read first.

Editor plugins and IDEs

A document that summarizes commonly used editor plugins and IDEs with
Go support.

Diagnostics

Summarizes tools and methodologies to diagnose problems in Go programs.

Managing dependencies

When your code uses external packages, those packages (distributed as modules) become dependencies.

Developing modules
Developing and publishing modules

You can collect related packages into modules, then publish the modules for other developers to use. This topic gives an overview of developing and publishing modules.

Module release and versioning workflow

When you develop modules for use by other developers, you can follow a workflow that helps ensure a reliable, consistent experience for developers using the module. This topic describes the high-level steps in that workflow.

Managing module source

When you're developing modules to publish for others to use, you can help ensure that your modules are easier for other developers to use by following the repository conventions described in this topic.

Developing a major version update

A major version update can be very disruptive to your module's users because it includes breaking changes and represents a new module. Learn more in this topic.

Publishing a module

When you want to make a module available for other developers, you publish it so that it's visible to Go tools. Once you've published the module, developers importing its packages will be able to resolve a dependency on the module by running commands such as go get.

Module version numbering

A module's developer uses each part of a module's version number to signal the version’s stability and backward compatibility. For each new release, a module's release version number specifically reflects the nature of the module's changes since the preceding release.

Talks

A Video Tour of Go

Three things that make Go fast, fun, and productive:
interfaces, reflection, and concurrency. Builds a toy web crawler to
demonstrate these.

Code that grows with grace

One of Go's key design goals is code adaptability; that it should be easy to take a simple design and build upon it in a clean and natural way. In this talk Andrew Gerrand describes a simple "chat roulette" server that matches pairs of incoming TCP connections, and then use Go's concurrency mechanisms, interfaces, and standard library to extend it with a web interface and other features. While the function of the program changes dramatically, Go's flexibility preserves the original design as it grows.

Go Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency is the key to designing high performance network services. Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) provide a simple and efficient means of expressing concurrent execution. In this talk we see how tricky concurrency problems can be solved gracefully with simple Go code.

Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns

This talk expands on the Go Concurrency Patterns talk to dive deeper into Go's concurrency primitives.

NBA Tells Head Coaches They Can Go Without Masks During Games

                  May 22, 2021 1:39 PM EDT
                





Just in time for the playoffs, the NBA told its head coaches Saturday they may work without masks during games if they have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Assistant coaches and players will still be required to wear masks in the bench area. Head coaches may choose to go without masks after pre-game introductions through halftime, then again after halftime until the game concludes. The memo, sent Saturday morning just a few hours before the postseason opener between Miami and Milwaukee and obtained by The Associated Press, also said that head coaches will have to wear masks during halftime, during warmups and shootaround before the start of the third quarter and postgame. If opposing coaches choose to meet briefly on the court after a game, masks are encouraged.




Coaches have needed to wear masks throughout games all season, and some even got calls from the NBA with a reminder to be more committed to keeping the masks over their nose and mouth. But for the playoffs, the league said it was making the mask change “to facilitate in-game coaching duties, and in light of vaccination rates among NBA head coaches” along with recent updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coaches will still need to participate in the NBA’s testing regimens, the league said. Meanwhile, for the playoffs, the NBA is going to see its largest crowds of the season. Miami announced Saturday that, starting with Game 3 of its series against Milwaukee on Thursday, it has increased capacity to 17,000 fans — basically double what it was planning to have for the start of the playoffs. The Heat said the NBA, along with local government, approved increased seating capacity, and it would remain in place for the rest of the playoffs. The 17,000 fans represent roughly 85% of the building’s capacity in Miami. The Boston Celtics said they are increasing attendance limits for Game 3 of their series against Brooklyn on Friday, and that for Game 4 on May 30 they will be at “near full capacity.” New York planned on welcoming up to 15,000 fans for its playoff games at Madison Square Garden against Atlanta, with that series starting Sunday, and Utah is prepared to host 13,000 fans to start its series against Memphis, also beginning Sunday. “You don’t realize how much you miss them. … It’s just great to see things sort of getting back to normal,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. More changes could be coming as the playoffs go along. The NBA hasn’t ruled out the possibility of having buildings able to return to 100% capacity for the NBA Finals in July, and the league is planning to evaluate whether teams can increase their travel parties starting with the second round of the playoffs. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports

                  May 19, 2021 12:47 AM EDT
                





TOKYO — The IOC and Tokyo Olympic organizers start three days of virtual meetings Wednesday and will run into some of the strongest medical-community opposition so far with the games set to open in just over eight weeks. The meetings are headed by IOC Vice President John Coates, who will attempt to again assure the Japanese population that the games will be “safe and secure.” Much of Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, is under a state of emergency, which forced IOC President Thomas Bach to cancel a trip to Japan this month. Only about 1-2% of the population is fully vaccinated, and opposition to the Olympics is running at 60-80% in numerous polls.




In one of the strongest statements so far, the 6,000-member Tokyo Medical Practitioners’ Association called for the Olympics to be canceled in a letter sent last week to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, and Seiko Hashimoto, the head of the organizing committee. The letter was made public this week on the group’s website. “We believe the correct choice is to the cancel an event that has the possibility of increasing the numbers of infected people and deaths,” the letter said. “Viruses are spread by people’s movements. Japan will hold a heavy responsibility if the Olympics and Paralympics work to worsen the pandemic, increasing the number of those who must suffer and die.” The Olympics are to open on July 23. The Paralympics follow on Aug. 24. They are a financial imperative for the International Olympic Committee, which derives about 75% of its incomes from selling television rights and another 18% from sponsorship. Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion or organize the Olympics, although government audits suggest the figure is much higher. There is no indication the games will be canceled, though opposition continues with small street protests and online petition drives. Last month the British Medical Journal  came out against holding the Olympics. Japan has had more than 11,500 deaths from COVID-19. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners’ Association warned of a possible collapse of Japan’s medical system, which could come under more pressure with Tokyo’s hot and humid summer months approaching as the Olympics open. “Our nation is now undergoing a surge in coronavirus patients in a fourth wave, the worst so far,” the letter said. “The medical systems responding to COVID-19 are stretched thin, almost to their limits. The reality is that the entire medical system faces an almost insurmountable hardship in trying our best to respond with coronavirus measures.” Tokyo organizers have said about 10,000 medical personnel will be needed during the Olympics. They have also asked for 500 extra nurses, and 200 sports medicine specialists. Several prefectures near Tokyo have said they will not give priority to treating Olympic athletes. “The doctors and nurses of the medical system who are being asked to respond are already at this point exhausted, and there is absolutely no extra manpower or facility for treatment,” the letter added.




Fans from abroad have already been banned, and Olympic organizers are expected to announce next month if local fans can attend in limited numbers. The Olympics and Paralympics will involve 15,000 athletes and tens of thousands of others entering Japan, which has had its borders virtually sealed for more than a year. ___ AP reporter Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report.

We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."Mr Tehan said he was "confident" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had "very positive discussions" with Ms Truss, the news.com.au website reported.image copyrightReutersimage captionFarmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operatorsIn 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at £20.1bn, and both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably.Currently, metals, wine and machines form the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia's main UK imports are cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks.Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would "have a massive impact" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations.She added: "We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."'Distinct advantages'The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed.And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was "strongly opposed" to ending tariffs and quotas.But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more "higher-end" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia.A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: "Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards."Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."Are you a farmer in the UK?

The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.8% in the three months to March, down from 4.9% in February, the Office for National Statistics said.The ONS said there were "early signs of recovery" in the jobs market,However, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020.The official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages.UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 yearsAre you currently unemployed? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.ukThe ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck.Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll "rose strongly in April" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough.But he said: "There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak."With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment."Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic."While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working."Business leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go.'I've applied for 500 jobs'As many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. Interior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed.She worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. "I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at," she told the BBC.She said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers."When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing."Although the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised."It destroys your confidence," she said. "I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs."You feel like you're stuck at square one."Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: "Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential."He added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June.Research consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was "insulating the labour market".The firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs.The most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were "at near pre-pandemic levels". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties.The jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month.The pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed.Are you currently unemployed?

"And while lenders are far more cautious than they were back in 2007, in this kind of market, there's still the risk buyers will lose their heads, and make a property mistake that could haunt them for years."'Huge inequalities'Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said the sharp rise in prices would mean fewer people were able to afford new homes."The effects are clear: with wages rising significantly more slowly than house prices, affordability constraints are increasing," she said."This is creating huge inequalities between older and younger generations, and growing demand from both younger and older renters who are priced out."For first-time buyers, this is a hideous market," she added. "With average prices up £24,000 in a year, saving a 10% deposit needs £2,400 extra in savings."image copyrightPA MediaTax breaksTax breaks introduced during the pandemic to boost the housing market had a marked effect over the period. The ONS report said: "Changes in the tax paid on housing transactions may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as the buyers' overall costs are reduced."A stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, which had been due to end in March, was recently extended.In Wales, a holiday on the equivalent tax has also been extended until the end of June 2021.A similar property transaction tax in Scotland ended on 31 March 2021."The extension of the stamp duty holiday helped ensure this won't be the last of the record months this year," said Sarah Coles.'Fear of missing out' fuels record house pricesUK housing market 'on the boil' as prices riseAverage house prices increased over the year in England to £275,000, a 10.2% annual increase.In Wales prices climbed 11% to £185,000, in Scotland 10.6% to £167,000 and in Northern Ireland they were up 6% to £149,000.In England, Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest annual house price growth, up 14% in the year to March.The lowest annual growth was in London, where average prices increased by 3.7% over the year.However, London's average house prices remained the most expensive of any region in the UK at an average of £500,000.Different propertyThe figures also suggested a switch in demand for different types of property.The average price of detached properties increased by 11.7% in the year to March 2021, while flats and maisonettes were up just 5.0% over the period."The demand for a new type of home, coupled with the government's mortgage guarantee scheme, will continue to support transaction levels in the months ahead, and potentially in the medium-term," said Andrew Montlake, managing director of independent mortgage broker Coreco. "Everything has changed due to the pandemic and that change will play out over several years yet."View commentsRelated TopicsUK economyHousing marketCoronavirus pandemicMore on this story'Fear of missing out' fuels record house pricesPublished10 MayUK housing market 'on the boil' as prices risePublished30 AprilTop StoriesWest accuses Belarus of hijacking planeThe EU and US consider sanctions after Belarus forced a plane carrying a dissident journalist to land.Published51 minutes agoJapan ramps up mass vaccinations amid Covid surgePublished48 minutes agoIndia marks 300,000 Covid deaths as pandemic ragesPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy the 'next Bali' is coming under fireThe embattled town that stood up to Myanmar's armyThe paper giving a voice to Aboriginal AustraliaChildren describe sickness and neglect in US asylum campsA conflict on pause as both sides claim victoryThe couple who met on YouTube.
